Hello!

This is my version of Wordle, programmed completely in Python. It accounts for all edge cases, and took a longer time than I would like to admit.

INSTRUCTIONS:

To play the game, the .txt file must be in the same folder with the .py file when running, as the .txt file is a bunch of words, allowing for the words to be randomized.
In the beginning of each game, you have to copy your FULL directory (NOT RELATIVE PATH) to the FOLDER where BOTH files are located. 
But after you figure that out, I recommend that you just set your directory beforehand, so you don't have to keep on pasting your directory.

Enjoy! :D
